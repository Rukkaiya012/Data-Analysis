This project demonstrates basic data analysis and visualization using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
The dataset used is a CSV file containing sales records, including the date of sale, product category, and sales amount.

The following is the project workflow:
Data Creation: Python's Pandas library is used to create a sample CSV file (sales_data.csv).
Data loading: It involves reading the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame so that it can be processed.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): To display the first few rows, verify the types of columns, and calculate basic statistics, the dataset is explored.
Data Aggregation: To determine the total sales for each product category, sales data is categorized.
Visualization: Matplotlib is used to create a bar chart that shows sales by category, which facilitates trend interpretation.

Result:
Calculated total sales value.
Sales summary by category is produced.
Bar charts offer visual insights.

Libraries & Tools:
Python
Pandas
Matplotlib

This project is appropriate for novices learning Python since it provides an introduction to data manipulation and visualization.
